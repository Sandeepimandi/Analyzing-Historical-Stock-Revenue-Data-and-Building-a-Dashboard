# Analyzing Historical Stock and Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard with Python

## Project Overview

In this project, I will take on the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst for a new startup investment firm that assists customers in making informed stock investments. My primary objective is to extract financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping techniques. The focus will be on two popular stocks: Tesla and GameStop. After gathering this data, I will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns and trends that can aid in investment decisions.

## Dashboard Analytics Displayed

The dashboard created in this project will present key performance indicators (KPIs) in a clear and concise manner. The project will involve analyzing datasets to extract KPIs, which will then be displayed on the dashboard. This will help in practicing the process of accessing and visualizing data. The dashboard will be built using Plotly, a powerful data visualization library in Python.

## Tools and Technologies

### Watson Studio
For this project, I will utilize Skills Network Labs and IBM Watson Studio:
- **Skills Network Labs**: A sandbox environment for learning and completing labs in various courses.
- **Watson Studio**: Part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, Watson Studio offers a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts to develop and deploy projects.
